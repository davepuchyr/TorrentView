This project was kicked-off at https://studio.firebase.google.com/studio-3959493840.

Dealing with the poor documentation for the Web UI of qBittorrent made the great start on the UI flop re the back-end implementation.  The back-end work to this point took way to long and still fails as of 2025.11.12.

Sorting works like a charm and is very, very useful, so the overall idea isn't bad.  Perhaps hacking https://github.com/VueTorrent/VueTorrent or another alternative implementation would be the path of least resistance.

The mission for this project had to be aborted because modernizing accounting by consolidating CapitalGains.xlsx and Worksheet-202*.xlsx took precedence.
